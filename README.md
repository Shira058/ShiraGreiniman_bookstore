Hey!!

As a homework assignment, I was required to build a website for bookstores.

I wrote the site in React, dividing it into components in a logical and organized way and using properties.
To enable smooth routing between the website pages, I added a router option from the React Router Dom library - which also allows adding navigation to the website in the future...
To share information between the different components I used reducer and store for saving different actions from the redux library.
For the design of the website, I used styled components - for pleasant and responsive design.
To get the data I used Apollo/Client from GraphQL.

Notice that I had to learn the new language by myself during the exercise -
so I will appreciate it if you would consider it when reviewing the website.

Thank you and have a good day!!
